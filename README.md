rapidrefresh
============

Tool for quickly reviewing lists. Give it a list and it'll flash each item at you, just as fast as you can read. (Or as fast as I can read!)

Use this tool to refresh yourself on long lists - stuff you know and just need a quick flash to keep top of mind, like Someday/Maybe reviews, a meeting wrap-up, or priming your mind with notes before a discussion.  I built it for refreshing myself on Customer Development conversations before making decisions about them.
